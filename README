RestAPI testing
    Cat facts site testing
    Used applications:
        - Windows               11 Pro
        - Pycharm Community     2024.1.3
        - Python                3.12.2
        - requests              2.32.3

Test cases:
    1. Functional           Default call response tests
    2. Functional           Response test with custom parameters
    3. KPI                  Check delay from sent request to response
    4. Stability            Check if response is received correctly with many iterations

Test case descriptions:
    Test case 1 - Sending request for random fact without parameters
    Step ID:    Step description:                                           Expected result:
    1           Send request for random cat fact with default parameters    Response in text field is at least 6 characters long.

    Test case 2 - Sending request for random fact without parameters
    Step ID:    Step description:                                           Expected result:
                Send request for random cat fact with parameters
    1           animal_type=cat and amount=2                                Response in text field is at least 6 characters long.

    Test case 3 - KPI for response time for cat site
    Step ID:    Step description:                                           Expected result:
    1           Get base site response time                                 10 requests sent with responses received
    2           Get response time for Cat site                              10 requests sent with responses received
    3           Compare times and check if results are inside KPI range     Cat site response time is lower then baseline site response time + 10 seconds
                                                                            Cat site response time is lower or equal then 15 seconds

    Test case 4 - KPI for response time for cat site
    Step ID:    Step description:                                           Expected result:
    1           Perform requests every 5 seconds for 30 minutes             every 5 seconds we receive response on our request
